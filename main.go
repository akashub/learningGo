//Itâ€™s a convention in Go to name the file that contains the main function as main.go, but other names work as well.

// can be run using ~/go/bin/learningGo
// also by go build, learningGo.exe
// go run main.go -> Works similar to go build/go install, but it requires extension .go 

//Under the hood, go run works much similar to go build. Instead of compiling and installing the program to the current directory, it compiles the file to a temporary location and runs the file from that location. If you are interested to know the location where go run compiles the file to, please run go run with the --work argument.
